## TweetDeck Chrome Extension

Recently, TweetDeck decided to make all tweets a thousand times harder to read by changing their `font-weight` to `300`.

This chrome extension simply changes that back to `400` and lets you easily read your tweets in TweetDeck.

### How to install

Download this repo, then open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your browser and drag the `tweetdeck-font-weight` folder into the browser window.
